            <h2>The Three Key Statements</h2>
            <p>Publicly traded companies are required to regularly issue financial statements to provide transparency to investors and regulators. Understanding how to read these documents is a critical skill for any investor. The three main statements are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement.</p>

            <h2>The Income Statement</h2>
            <p>The income statement, also known as the profit and loss (P&L) statement, shows a company's financial performance over a specific period (e.g., a quarter or a year). It starts with the company's <span class="highlight">revenue</span> and subtracts various costs and expenses to arrive at the <span class="highlight">net income</span>, or "bottom line."</p>

            <h2>The Balance Sheet</h2>
            <p>The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a single point in time. It follows the fundamental accounting equation: <span class="highlight">Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity</span>. It shows what a company owns (assets) and what it owes (liabilities).</p>

            <h2>The Cash Flow Statement</h2>
            <p>The cash flow statement measures how well a company manages its cash position, meaning how well the company generates cash to pay its debt obligations and fund its operating expenses. It is broken down into three activities: <span class="highlight">operating, investing, and financing</span>.</p>
