            <p>Earnings Per Share (EPS) is a key financial metric that represents a company's profitability on a per-share basis. It indicates how much money a company makes for each share of its stock.</p>

            <h2>Definition:</h2>
            <p>EPS is calculated by taking a company's net income, subtracting any preferred dividends, and then dividing that amount by the number of common shares outstanding.</p>

            <h2>Significance:</h2>
            <p>EPS is a widely used and important metric for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profitability Indicator:</strong> A higher EPS generally suggests that a company is more profitable.</li>
                <li><strong>Valuation Tool:</strong> It is a crucial component in estimating a company's corporate value and is frequently used in conjunction with other metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to determine if a stock is reasonably valued.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Decision-Making:</strong> Investors and analysts rely on EPS to assess a company's financial performance, compare its investment potential against competitors, and make informed decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Share Price Influence:</strong> Consistent growth in a company's EPS can increase investor demand for its shares, potentially leading to a higher stock price.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Earnings Prediction:</strong> EPS figures are also used to help predict a company's future earnings.</li>
            </ul>
