            <p>Here are the definitions and significance of EBITDA Margin, Operating Margin, and Net Profit Margin:</p>

            <h2>EBITDA Margin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> EBITDA Margin is a profitability ratio that measures a company's operating profit as a percentage of its revenue, before accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It provides a clearer picture of a company's core operational profitability by excluding non-operating expenses and non-cash items.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>EBITDA Margin = (EBITDA / Revenue) * 100</code></li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> It's useful for comparing the profitability of different companies within the same industry, as it removes the effects of financing and accounting decisions (like depreciation methods) that can vary widely. A higher EBITDA margin generally indicates better operational efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Operating Margin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Operating Margin (also known as Operating Profit Margin or Return on Sales) measures how much profit a company makes from its core operations for every dollar of revenue. It accounts for the cost of goods sold and operating expenses (like salaries, rent, and utilities), but excludes interest and taxes.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Operating Margin = (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100</code></li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This metric is a strong indicator of a company's operational efficiency and pricing strategy. A consistently high operating margin suggests that a company is effectively managing its costs and has strong control over its core business activities. It's a good measure of a company's ability to generate profit from its primary business.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Net Profit Margin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Net Profit Margin (or Net Income Margin) is the percentage of revenue left after all expenses, including cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest, and taxes, have been deducted. It represents the ultimate profitability of a company.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) * 100</code></li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This is often considered the "bottom line" profitability measure. A higher net profit margin indicates that a company is more efficient at converting revenue into actual profit available to shareholders. It reflects the overall financial health and efficiency of a company, taking into account all costs and income streams.</li>
            </ul>
