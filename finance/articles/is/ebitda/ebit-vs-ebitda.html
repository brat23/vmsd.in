        </header>
        <main>
            <p>EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) are both financial metrics used to assess a company's profitability, but they differ in what expenses they exclude.</p>

            <h2>EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)</h2>
            <p>EBIT, often referred to as operating profit, measures a company's profitability from its core operations before accounting for interest expenses and income taxes. It reflects how much profit a company generates from its main business activities, excluding the effects of financing decisions and tax environments.</p>

            <h2>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)</h2>
            <p>EBITDA is a measure of core corporate profitability that goes a step further than EBIT. It excludes interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization from earnings. It is often used as a loose proxy for cash flow from a company's operations and helps evaluate a business's ability to generate cash.</p>

            <h2>Key Differences</h2>
            <p>The primary distinction between EBIT and EBITDA lies in their treatment of depreciation and amortization:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EBIT</strong> includes depreciation and amortization expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>EBITDA</strong> excludes depreciation and amortization expenses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depreciation is the accounting method used to allocate the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, while amortization is the equivalent for intangible assets (like patents or software). Both are non-cash expenses, meaning they reduce a company's reported profit but do not involve an actual outflow of cash.</p>

            <h2>Purpose and Usage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EBIT</strong> provides insight into a company's operational efficiency, allowing for comparisons between companies with different debt levels and tax situations.</li>
                <li><strong>EBITDA</strong> is often favored in capital-intensive industries because it removes the significant non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, providing a clearer view of operational performance before these non-cash charges. Lenders often use EBITDA to assess a company's ability to repay debt.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to note that neither EBIT nor EBITDA are recognized as standard metrics under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).</p>
