            <p>The <strong>statutory tax rate</strong> is the legally imposed tax rate on income, as set by law. It's the official rate before any deductions, exemptions, or credits are applied.</p>

            <p>The <strong>effective tax rate</strong> is the actual rate of tax paid by an individual or a company on their taxable income, after taking into account all deductions, exemptions, and credits. It is calculated by dividing the total tax paid by the taxable income.</p>

            <h2>Key Differences:</h2>
