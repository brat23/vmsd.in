        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) represents the direct costs incurred by a company in producing the goods it sells during a specific period. It is also referred to as the cost of products sold or cost of sales. This metric reflects the carrying value of the goods that have been sold.</p>

            <h2>Components of COGS</h2>
            <p>COGS primarily includes direct costs directly tied to the production of goods. These components typically are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Materials:</strong> The cost of raw materials and components used to manufacture a product, including freight or shipping charges to acquire them.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Labor:</strong> Wages and salaries for employees directly involved in the production process, along with associated costs like payroll taxes and benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing Overhead:</strong> Expenses related to the production facility, such as utility costs for the factory, depreciation on manufacturing equipment, and maintenance expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Costs:</strong> The cost of storing raw materials and finished products before they are sold.</li>
                <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> The total cost of goods purchased by the company during the accounting period.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Adjustments:</strong> COGS is often calculated using the formula: Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to note that COGS excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs, sales force costs, marketing, advertising, and general administrative expenses (operating expenses).</p>

            <h2>Importance of COGS</h2>
            <p>COGS is a crucial financial metric for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Determines Gross Profit:</strong> COGS is subtracted from a company's revenue to calculate its gross profit, which indicates how much profit a company makes from its sales before accounting for operating expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluates Efficiency:</strong> It helps assess a company's efficiency in managing its production processes, labor, and supply chain.</li>
                <li><strong>Informs Pricing Strategies:</strong> Understanding COGS is essential for setting competitive and profitable prices for products, ensuring that costs are covered and a desired profit margin is achieved.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitors Financial Performance:</strong> Management and investors use COGS to monitor the business's overall financial health and performance over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Implications:</strong> COGS plays a significant role in tax calculations, as certain expenses included in COGS cannot be deducted again as general business expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Aids Business Decisions:</strong> Accurate COGS calculation assists in making informed decisions regarding supplier changes, identifying areas of profit loss, and improving operational efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Impacts Profitability:</strong> Effectively managing and reducing COGS through better supplier deals or increased production efficiency can directly lead to higher net profits.</li>
            </ul>
