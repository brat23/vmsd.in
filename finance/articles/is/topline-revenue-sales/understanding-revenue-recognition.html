            <h1>Understanding Revenue Recognition</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Revenue recognition is an accounting principle that dictates when revenue should be recorded in a company's financial statements. The core idea is that revenue is recognized when it is earned, regardless of when the cash is received.</p>

            <h2>Key Principles:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify the contract with a customer:</strong> A contract exists when there's an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify the performance obligations in the contract:</strong> These are promises to transfer distinct goods or services to the customer.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine the transaction price:</strong> This is the amount of consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services.</li>
                <li><strong>Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations:</strong> If a contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each based on its relative standalone selling price.</li>
                <li><strong>Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation:</strong> Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. This can be at a point in time (e.g., when a product is delivered) or over a period of time (e.g., for subscription services).</li>
            </ol>
