            <p>Net revenue, also known as net sales, represents the total income a business generates from sales after accounting for certain deductions. It provides a more accurate reflection of a company's actual earnings from its core operations.</p>

            <h2>Significance of Net Revenue</h2>
            <p>Net revenue is a crucial financial metric for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accurate Financial Picture:</strong> Unlike gross revenue, which is the total sales before any deductions, net revenue offers a clearer and more realistic insight into a company's financial performance and profitability.</li>
                <li><strong>Informed Decision-Making:</strong> Understanding net revenue helps businesses make better decisions regarding resource allocation, strategic planning, and pricing strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Evaluation:</strong> It serves as a key benchmark to evaluate sales performance and customer interactions, indicating the effectiveness of sales efforts. A decline in net revenue can signal issues such as increased product returns or ineffective pricing.</li>
                <li><strong>True Earning Potential:</strong> It reflects the actual amount of money the company has earned from its sales after accounting for factors that reduce the initial sales figure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Calculation of Net Revenue</h2>
            <p>The most common way to calculate net revenue is by subtracting returns, allowances, and discounts from gross revenue (total sales).</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong><br>
            Net Revenue = Gross Revenue - (Returns + Discounts + Allowances)</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gross Revenue:</strong> The total amount of money earned from sales before any deductions.</li>
                <li><strong>Returns:</strong> The value of goods returned by customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Discounts:</strong> Price reductions offered to customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Allowances:</strong> Reductions in price given to customers, often due to issues like defective items or a compromise between buyer and seller.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, if a company has a gross revenue of $100,000, with $5,000 in returns, $2,000 in allowances, and $3,000 in discounts, the net revenue would be calculated as:<br>
            Net Revenue = $100,000 - ($5,000 + $2,000 + $3,000) = $100,000 - $10,000 = $90,000.</p>
