        <main>
            <p>Gross revenue, often referred to as the "top line" or "gross sales," represents the total income a business generates from all its primary activities before any expenses, deductions, or allowances are subtracted. It encompasses all money earned from sources like product sales, services, interest, investments, royalties, and subscription fees.</p>

            <h2>Significance of Gross Revenue</h2>
            <p>Gross revenue is a crucial financial metric for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Assessment of Financial Health and Performance:</strong> It provides a fundamental indicator of a company's overall financial performance and profitability.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicator of Growth and Potential:</strong> Changes in gross revenue can signal business growth and demonstrate a company's capacity to generate sales and meet market demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Attracting Stakeholders:</strong> Investors and financial partners often examine gross revenue to gauge a company's investment security and potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Foundation for Financial Reporting:</strong> As the starting point on an income statement, it is essential for creating budgets, forecasts, and financial projections.</li>
                <li><strong>Sales Performance Insight:</strong> It highlights the total sales volume and the market demand for a company's offerings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Calculation of Gross Revenue</h2>
            <p>To calculate gross revenue, you sum up all income streams generated by the business within a specific reporting period.</p>
            <p>The general formula is:</p>
            <p><strong>Gross Revenue = Sum of all income streams</strong></p>
            <p>More specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For businesses selling products: Multiply the number of units sold by the price per unit.</li>
                <li>For service-based businesses: Multiply the number of services sold by the price per service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, if a business earns $20,000 from in-store sales, $30,000 from online sales, and $5,000 from investment dividends, its gross revenue would be $55,000.</p>
