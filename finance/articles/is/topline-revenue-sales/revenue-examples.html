            <p>Revenue streams are the various sources from which a business generates income through the sale of goods or the provision of services. Understanding these streams is crucial for a business's financial health and growth.</p>

                <li><strong>Non-Operating Revenues:</strong> Money earned from a business's side activities, not directly related to its core operations. Examples include interest revenue from investments or rent revenue from leasing out property.</li>
            </ul>
