            <p>Interest expense on loans, bonds, and credit lines is typically reported as a non-operating expense on a company's income statement. It represents the cost of borrowing money. It is usually presented as a separate line item, often under a section like "Other Expenses" or "Financial Expenses," after the calculation of operating income. This allows users of the financial statements to distinguish between a company's core operating performance and its financing costs.</p>
