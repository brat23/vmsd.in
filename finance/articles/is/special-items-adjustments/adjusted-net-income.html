            <p>Analysts calculate Adjusted Net Income for several key reasons, primarily to gain a more accurate and normalized view of financial performance, both for businesses and individuals.</p>

            <h2>For companies and investors, Adjusted Net Income helps to:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remove distortions:</strong> by excluding unusual, one-time, non-cash, or extraordinary items (e.g., gains/losses from asset sales, legal settlements, restructuring charges, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation). This provides a clearer picture of a company's ongoing, core profitability and financial health.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate core strength and long-term prospects:</strong> by focusing on recurring earnings, which allows investors to assess a company's sustainable profitability and growth potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitate comparisons:</strong> between companies in the same industry or over different periods, as it removes the impact of unique events or accounting differences that can skew reported net income.</li>
                <li><strong>Assess value for acquisition:</strong> as potential buyers are interested in a business's worth as an acquired asset, factoring in expenses and income streams that might shift under new ownership.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>For individuals (especially in the UK), Adjusted Net Income (ANI) is calculated to:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Determine tax liabilities:</strong> and ensure accurate tax calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Assess eligibility for tax reliefs, allowances, and benefits:</strong> such as the personal allowance, pension contributions tax relief, or the High-Income Child Benefit Charge.</li>
                <li><strong>Aid in financial planning:</strong> by helping individuals understand how their income affects their tax obligations and benefit entitlements.</li>
            </ul>
