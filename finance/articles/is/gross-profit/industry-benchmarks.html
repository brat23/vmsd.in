            <h1>Industry Benchmarks (High vs Low Margin Industries)</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Gross profit margin industry benchmarks vary significantly, reflecting differences in business models, cost structures, competition, and value propositions. The average gross profit margin across all industries is approximately 36.56%.</p>

            <h2>High Gross Profit Margin Industries</h2>
            <p>Industries with high gross profit margins typically benefit from low costs of goods sold (COGS), strong intellectual property, high barriers to entry, and pricing power. These often include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Finance and Banking:</strong> Banks, particularly money center and regional banks, consistently report exceptionally high gross profit margins, often near 100%. Investment banking and securities dealings also show very high margins, sometimes exceeding 50%.</li>
                <li><strong>Software and Services:</strong> Software companies, especially those offering Software as a Service (SaaS), frequently achieve gross margins of 70-90% due to minimal COGS after initial development and recurring revenue models. Technology consulting also falls into this high-margin category (50-70%).</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Services:</strong> Sectors like legal services, accounting, and consulting enjoy high margins (e.g., 15-35% for financial/legal services, 20-30% for consulting) because they primarily sell specialized expertise with low material costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare Equipment & Supplies:</strong> This industry also demonstrates high gross profit margins.</li>
                <li><strong>Aerospace & Defense:</strong> Companies in this sector often have gross margins of 40-50%, driven by government contracts, proprietary technology, and limited competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Biotechnology:</strong> While net profit margins can be volatile, gross profit margins in biotechnology can be high, around 87.3%.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Low Gross Profit Margin Industries</h2>
            <p>Conversely, industries with low gross profit margins are often characterized by high COGS, intense competition, high capital requirements, and reliance on volume sales. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automotive:</strong> The auto and truck industry consistently exhibits some of the lowest gross profit margins, with figures around 12.45% for the sector and 9.7% for auto manufacturers. Car dealerships also operate on thin margins (1-5%) from sales, often relying on financing and services for profitability.</li>
                <li><strong>Retail (especially Grocery):</strong> Grocery stores typically have very low gross profit margins (1-5%), depending on high sales volumes to generate overall profit. Other retail segments like electronics (15-25%) also have comparatively lower margins.</li>
                <li><strong>Construction:</strong> High costs for labor and materials contribute to lower gross margins, typically ranging from 3-7%.</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation & Logistics:</strong> This sector faces slim margins (3-6%) due to significant expenses like fuel, labor, and vehicle maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>Farming/Agriculture:</strong> This industry generally operates with lower gross margins, around 16.49%.</li>
                <li><strong>Wholesale:</strong> Wholesalers of agricultural products, alcoholic beverages, and petroleum products are known for their low profit margins.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil and Gas Extraction:</strong> This industry can experience low or even negative net profit margins due to market volatility and high operational costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Green & Renewable Energy:</strong> This emerging sector can face challenges with high upfront costs, leading to lower or negative net margins in some cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In summary, service-oriented industries and those with strong intellectual property or high barriers to entry tend to have higher gross profit margins, while manufacturing, retail, and commodity-based industries often operate with much tighter margins.</p>
