            <p>Gross Profit Margin (%) is a financial metric that indicates the percentage of revenue left after deducting the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). It is also known as the gross margin ratio.</p>

            <h2>Calculation:</h2>
            <p>The formula for Gross Profit Margin is:</p>
            <p><strong>Gross Profit Margin (%) = ((Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue) * 100%</strong></p>

            <h2>Why it Matters:</h2>
            <p>Gross Profit Margin is a crucial indicator for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial Health and Efficiency:</strong> It assesses a company's financial health and its efficiency in producing goods or services. A higher gross profit margin generally indicates more efficient operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> It shows how much profit a company makes from its sales after accounting for the direct costs of doing business. It signals profitability and can reveal if pricing is too low or costs are too high.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Flow for Operations and Growth:</strong> The gross profit amount indicates how much money a company has available to cover administrative expenses and operating costs, and to invest in business growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pricing Strategy:</strong> It helps inform pricing decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> Investors and analysts use gross profit margins to compare the profitability of companies within the same industry or across different market segments.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying Areas for Improvement:</strong> Companies use this metric to identify areas for cost-cutting and sales improvement. A declining margin can signal issues with pricing, supply chain management, or operational inefficiencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Benchmarking:</strong> It allows businesses to benchmark their financial performance against industry averages.</li>
            </ul>
