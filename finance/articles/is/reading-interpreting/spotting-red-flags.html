            <h1>Spotting red flags (declining margins, rising OPEX, inconsistent other income)</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>When analyzing an income statement, several red flags can indicate underlying financial issues or even potential manipulation. Key areas to scrutinize include declining margins, rising operating expenses (OPEX), and inconsistent other income.</p>

            <h2>Declining Margins</h2>
            <p>A consistent decline in profit margins, whether gross, operating, or net, is a significant red flag.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decreasing Gross Profit Margin:</strong> This indicates that the cost of goods sold (COGS) is increasing faster than revenue, or that the company is unable to sell its products or services at favorable prices. It suggests problems with pricing power, rising production costs, or operational inefficiencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Shrinking Operating Margins:</strong> If operating margins are declining faster than gross margins, it points to issues in managing operating costs. This could be due to wasteful spending, difficulty controlling expenses, or a lack of strategic investments. Inconsistent margins without clear reasons may also signal accounting manipulation or one-time events.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rising Operating Expenses (OPEX)</h2>
            <p>When operating expenses grow disproportionately to revenue, it signals declining operating efficiency and can be a major concern.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>OPEX Growing Faster than Revenue:</strong> This trend suggests that the company is struggling to control its overhead costs, such as administrative, sales, and marketing expenses. It can indicate operational instability or a lack of cost management.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Wage Costs:</strong> If wage costs are rising at a faster rate than revenue, it can erode profitability.</li>
                <li><strong>Abnormal Expenses:</strong> Unexplained or abnormal expenses that do not align with a company's operations could be a sign of financial irregularities or even fraudulent activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Inconsistent Other Income</h2>
            <p>"Other income" typically includes non-operating gains or losses. Inconsistent or unusually large amounts in this section can be a red flag.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heavy Reliance on Non-Operating Income:</strong> If a company's net income is significantly boosted by one-time gains or income from sources outside its core operations, it might be masking underlying operational weaknesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Unusual Gains or Losses:</strong> Large, non-recurring transactions, such as the sale of assets, can be used to manipulate earnings and present a healthier financial picture than is truly the case. A high proportion of revenue from vague "other" sources can also hide questionable practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Sudden Changes in Income:</strong> Any sudden, unexplained spike or drop in reported income can draw scrutiny, as it might suggest unreported earnings or improper deductions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In summary, a thorough analysis of an income statement involves not just looking at the bottom line, but also examining trends in margins, the growth of operating expenses relative to revenue, and the nature and consistency of other income. These elements, when showing adverse trends or unusual patterns, warrant further investigation into a company's financial health.</p>
