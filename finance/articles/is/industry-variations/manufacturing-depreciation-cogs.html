            <h1>Manufacturing: heavy depreciation & COGS</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>In the manufacturing industry, both depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) are typically high due to the capital-intensive nature of production and the direct costs involved in transforming raw materials into finished goods.</p>

            <h2>Heavy Depreciation:</h2>
            <p>Manufacturing companies invest heavily in machinery, equipment, and facilities, which are long-term assets. These assets undergo significant wear and tear due to continuous operation and can quickly become obsolete due to technological advancements. The depreciation of these assets, particularly those directly involved in the production process, is a substantial cost that is often included as part of the Cost of Goods Sold.</p>

            <h2>High Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</h2>
            <p>COGS in manufacturing encompasses all direct costs associated with producing the goods sold. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raw Materials:</strong> The direct cost of materials consumed in the production process.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Labor:</strong> Wages and benefits paid to employees directly involved in manufacturing the products.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing Overhead:</strong> Indirect costs related to production, such as factory rent, utilities, equipment maintenance, and the aforementioned depreciation of manufacturing assets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The complexity of the manufacturing process, which involves converting raw materials into finished products, makes COGS more intricate to calculate compared to other industries. High COGS directly impacts a company's gross profit, a crucial indicator of financial health. Furthermore, inefficiencies, waste, and the chosen inventory valuation method can also contribute to higher COGS in manufacturing.</p>
