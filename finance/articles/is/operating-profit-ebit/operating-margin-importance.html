            <p>Operating Margin (%) is a crucial financial metric that indicates a company's profitability and operational efficiency. It measures how much profit a company makes for every dollar of revenue from its core business activities, after deducting direct costs and operating expenses, but before accounting for interest and taxes.</p>

            <p>The importance of Operating Margin (%) stems from several key aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profitability Assessment:</strong> It provides insight into a company's ability to generate profits from its primary operations, revealing the true profitability of its core business.</li>
                <li><strong>Operational Efficiency and Cost Control:</strong> A higher operating margin suggests that a company is well-managed and efficient in controlling its costs and converting revenue into profit. It helps identify areas where costs can be cut and efficiency improved.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Health Indicator:</strong> This metric serves as a comprehensive indicator of a business's overall financial health and performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Investor and Stakeholder Evaluation:</strong> Investors and analysts frequently use operating margin to evaluate a company's financial stability, performance, and risk, as a higher margin can signal a more attractive investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> It enables easy comparison of financial performance and stability between companies within the same industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth Potential:</strong> A consistent and healthy operating margin can be an indicator of a company's potential for future growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Trend Monitoring:</strong> Regularly tracking the operating margin helps businesses monitor financial performance trends, identify deviations, and take timely corrective actions.</li>
            </ul>
