            <h1>Difference Between Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>The income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement are three core financial documents that provide different views of a company's financial health. Understanding them individually and how they connect is crucial for assessing a business's performance.</p>

            <h2>1. Income Statement (The "Profit & Loss" or "P&L" Statement)</h2>
            <p>The income statement shows a company's profitability over a specific period, like a month, quarter, or year. Think of it as a video recording of the company's financial performance during that time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Question Answered:</strong> "How profitable was the company?"</li>
                <li><strong>Time Frame:</strong> A period of time (e.g., January 1 to December 31).</li>
                <li><strong>Core Formula:</strong> Revenues - Expenses = Net Income.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Balance Sheet (The "Statement of Financial Position")</h2>
            <p>The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial health at a single point in time. It reveals what a company owns and what it owes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Question Answered:</strong> "What is the company's net worth?" or "What does the company own and owe?"</li>
                <li><strong>Time Frame:</strong> A single point in time (e.g., as of December 31).</li>
                <li><strong>Core Formula:</strong> Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity. This equation must always balance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cash Flow Statement (CFS)</h2>
            <p>The cash flow statement tracks the movement of cash both into and out of the company over a period. It is crucial because profit on an income statement doesn't always equal cash in the bank, due to non-cash expenses like depreciation and credit sales.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Question Answered:</strong> "Where did the company's cash come from and where did it go?"</li>
                <li><strong>Time Frame:</strong> A period of time (e.g., January 1 to December 31).</li>
                <li><strong>Core Formula:</strong> Cash from Operations + Cash from Investing + Cash from Financing = Net Change in Cash.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How They Are All Connected</h2>
            <p>The three statements are intricately linked and tell a cohesive story about a company's financial health:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Net Income Links the Income Statement to the Other Two:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>Net Income</strong> from the income statement is the starting point for the <strong>Cash Flow Statement's</strong> operating activities section.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Net Income</strong> also flows into the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> under Shareholders' Equity as "Retained Earnings" (profits that are reinvested in the company).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet are Linked:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ending cash balance on the <strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong> is the cash figure shown in the assets section of the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> for that period.</li>
                        <li>Changes in balance sheet items like inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are used to calculate the cash flow from operations on the <strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Activities like buying equipment (investing) or taking out a loan (financing) on the <strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong> directly impact the assets and liabilities on the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
