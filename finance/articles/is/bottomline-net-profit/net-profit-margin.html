            <p>The Net Profit Margin (%) is a profitability ratio that indicates how much profit a company makes for every dollar of revenue it generates. It reflects the percentage of revenue that is retained as net income after all expenses, including operating costs, non-operating expenses, interest, and taxes, have been deducted.</p>

            <h2>Calculation:</h2>
            <p>The formula for Net Profit Margin is:</p>
            <p><strong>Net Profit Margin (%) = (Net Income / Revenue) Ã— 100</strong></p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net Income</strong> is the company's earnings after all expenses and taxes have been subtracted from revenue.</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue</strong> is the total sales or income generated by the company from its primary operations.</li>
            </ul>
