            <p>Net profit, also known as the bottom line, is the amount of money a company has left after subtracting all expenses, including operating costs, interest, and taxes, from its total revenue. Its meaning varies for different stakeholders:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Investors:</strong> For investors, net profit is a crucial indicator of a company's profitability and financial health. A higher net profit generally suggests a more successful and efficient business, which can lead to higher stock prices, dividends, and overall returns on their investment. It helps them assess the company's ability to generate wealth for its shareholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong> Management uses net profit as a key metric to evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies and operational decisions. It helps them identify areas for cost reduction, revenue enhancement, and overall business improvement. Net profit often influences performance bonuses and strategic planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Employees:</strong> While not directly impacting their daily wages, a healthy net profit indicates job security and the potential for growth within the company. Profitable companies are more likely to invest in employee development, offer better benefits, and provide opportunities for promotions or raises. Conversely, consistent losses could signal layoffs or a decline in benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Creditors:</strong> Creditors (lenders) view net profit as a measure of a company's ability to repay its debts. A consistent and strong net profit indicates that the company has sufficient cash flow to meet its financial obligations, making it a more reliable borrower. It influences the company's creditworthiness and the terms of future loans.</li>
            </ul>
