            <p>"Net Income," also known as "Net Earnings" or "Net Profit," is commonly referred to as "the bottom line" in business and finance. This term signifies the final profit a company or individual achieves after all expenses, taxes, and deductions have been subtracted from their total revenue.</p>

            <p>It is called "the bottom line" because it is typically the last figure presented on a company's income statement, also known as a Profit & Loss (P&L) statement. This figure is a crucial indicator of a company's financial health and overall profitability, showing whether the entity is operating at a profit or a loss.</p>

            <p>The calculation for net income involves subtracting all costs, such as the cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest, and taxes, from the total revenue.</p>
