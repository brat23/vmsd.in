            <p>"Other Operating Expenses" in an income statement refer to costs incurred by a business that are related to its core operations but do not fall into more specific categories like Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, or research and development (R&D).</p>

            <p>These expenses are typically recurring and necessary for the day-to-day functioning of the business, but they might not be directly tied to the production or sale of goods/services.</p>

            <h2>Common examples of Other Operating Expenses include:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rent expense (for office or administrative spaces)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Utilities (for office or administrative spaces)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Depreciation and amortization (for operating assets)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Insurance expense</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Repairs and maintenance (for operating assets)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Legal and accounting fees</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Travel and entertainment expenses</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Office supplies</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Bad debt expense</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Miscellaneous operating expenses</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The specific items categorized under "Other Operating Expenses" can vary between companies and industries, depending on their nature and materiality. The goal is to provide a clear and accurate picture of a company's operational costs.</p>
