        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Research and Development (R&D) expenses represent the costs a company incurs for activities aimed at innovating, improving existing products, or developing new ones. These expenses are typically found on a company's income statement, usually listed under operating expenses.</p>

            <p>The accounting treatment of R&D expenses—whether they are expensed immediately or capitalized as an asset—varies depending on the accounting standards followed (U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards) and the nature of the R&D activity.</p>

            <h2>Under U.S. GAAP:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Most R&D costs are required to be expensed in the period they are incurred. This is primarily due to the inherent uncertainty regarding whether R&D activities will generate future economic benefits.</li>
                <li>There are limited exceptions where R&D costs may be capitalized:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Costs for materials, equipment, or facilities that have an alternative future use beyond a specific R&D project.</li>
                        <li>Intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions that are intended for R&D activities.</li>
                        <li>Certain software development costs, specifically those incurred after technological feasibility has been established and before the product is released for sale.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Under IFRS (IAS 38):</h2>
            <p>IFRS distinguishes between the research and development phases of a project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research Phase:</strong> All expenditures incurred during the research phase must be expensed to the income statement as they are incurred. This is because it is generally impossible to demonstrate that a product or service at the research stage will generate probable future economic benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Phase:</strong> Costs incurred during the development phase can be capitalized as an intangible asset if specific criteria are met. These criteria include demonstrating technical feasibility, commercial viability, the intention to complete and use or sell the asset, the ability to use or sell the asset, the availability of adequate resources, and the ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the asset. If these criteria are not met, the development costs must also be expensed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impact on the Income Statement:</h2>
            <p>When R&D costs are expensed, they directly reduce a company's net income in the period they are incurred. This approach can lead to volatility in reported profits, especially for companies with significant and fluctuating R&D investments. If R&D costs are capitalized (as permitted under IFRS for development or in specific GAAP exceptions), they are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and then amortized (expensed over time) on the income statement, spreading the cost over the asset's useful life. This can result in a smoother profit picture and may better reflect the long-term investment nature of R&D.</p>
