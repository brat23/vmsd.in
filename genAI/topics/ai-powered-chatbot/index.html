Gather relevant documents (e.g., product manuals, FAQs, lesson plans) that your chatbot will use as its source of truth.</li><li>Use a system prompt or custom instruction to give the chatbot its persona and core instructions (e.g., "You are a helpful customer support agent for... Your goal is to answer questions based ONLY on the provided documents.").</li><li>Build a simple chat interface where a user can have a conversation with the bot.</li><li>Manage the conversation history and include it in your API calls to allow for follow-up questions and context retention.</li></ol><h2>Stretch Goals</h2><ul><li>Implement a basic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system, where you first search the knowledge base for relevant text and then inject that text into the prompt for the LLM to use when forming its answer.</li></ul></main></div></body></html>
