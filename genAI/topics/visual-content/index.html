These tools can translate text descriptions (prompts) into unique, high-quality images in a vast range of styles.</p><h2>Design Assistance</h2><p>Beyond creating final images, these tools are invaluable for design assistance. You can use them to:<ul><li>Create mood boards to establish a visual style for a project.</li><li>Generate logos, icons, and other design elements.</li><li>Create illustrations and concept art for presentations, websites, and games.</li><li>Visualize different product designs or architectural concepts quickly.</li></ul></p><h2>Prompting for Images</h2><p>Prompting for images is a different skill than prompting for text. Effective image prompts are often highly detailed, specifying not just the subject, but also the style, lighting, composition, color palette, and even the type of camera or lens that should be simulated.</p></main></div></body></html>
