Each agent is assigned a specific role and a set of skills, and they collaborate by exchanging information and delegating tasks.</p><h2>Example: A Research Team</h2><p>You could create an AI agent team to write a research report:<ul><li><strong>Agent 1 (Researcher):</strong> Scours the web and academic databases to find relevant information.</li><li><strong>Agent 2 (Analyst):</strong> Receives the raw information from the Researcher, synthesizes it, and identifies key insights.</li><li><strong>Agent 3 (Writer):</strong> Takes the insights from the Analyst and drafts them into a well-structured report.</li><li><strong>Agent 4 (Critic):</strong> Reviews the report from the Writer, identifies weaknesses, and suggests improvements.</li></ul><p>Frameworks like AutoGen from Microsoft make it possible to build and orchestrate these multi-agent workflows.</p></main></div></body></html>
