LLMs can be used to build and interpret predictive models, making this advanced capability more accessible.</p><h2>Building Predictive Models with AI</h2><p>You can describe a dataset and your prediction goal to an AI (e.g., "Using this customer data, predict which users are likely to churn next month"), and it can generate the necessary code (e.g., in Python) to train a machine learning model, such as a logistic regression or a random forest, to perform the prediction.</p><h2>Interpreting Results</h2><p>Beyond just building the model, an LLM can help you interpret the results. It can explain which features were most important in the model's predictions and summarize the model's performance in plain English, bridging the gap between complex data science and business decision-making.</p></main></div></body></html>
