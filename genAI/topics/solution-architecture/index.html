This often involves chaining multiple prompts or even multiple AI models together.</p><h2>Example: Automated Reporting</h2><p>Imagine you want to create a weekly sales report. Your solution architecture might be:<ul><li><strong>Step 1 (Data Extraction):</strong> A script automatically pulls the latest sales data from a database.</li><li><strong>Step 2 (AI Analysis):</strong> The data is fed to an LLM with a prompt asking it to identify key trends, top-performing products, and regional differences.</li><li><strong>Step 3 (AI Summarization):</strong> The output from the analysis step is fed into a second prompt that asks the AI to write a concise, executive-level summary of the findings.</li><li><strong>Step 4 (Distribution):</strong> The summary is automatically formatted into an email and sent to stakeholders.</li></ul></p></main></div></body></html>
