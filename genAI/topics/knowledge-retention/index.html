AI can help you implement scientifically-backed techniques for improving long-term knowledge retention.</p><h2>AI-Generated Quizzes</h2><p>After reading a chapter or watching a lecture, ask an LLM to act as a quiz master. You can have it generate multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, or even complex scenario-based problems to test your understanding of the material. This practice of active recall is one of the most effective ways to strengthen memory.</p><h2>Spaced Repetition</h2><p>Spaced Repetition is a technique where you review information at increasing intervals over time.
