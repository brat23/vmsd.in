A well-designed workflow ensures that you are using the right tool for the right task and maintaining high standards of academic integrity.</p><h2>A Sample Workflow</h2><ol><li><strong>Brainstorming & Refinement:</strong> Use an LLM to brainstorm initial research ideas and then refine them into specific, answerable questions.</li><li><strong>Literature Discovery:</strong> Use AI-powered academic search engines (like Semantic Scholar) or prompt an LLM to help you find key authors and papers in your field.</li><li><strong>Summarization & Synthesis:</strong> Feed key papers into an LLM to get concise summaries. Synthesize findings from multiple papers to build your literature review.</li><li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Use AI tools to analyze your data, whether it's coding qualitative data, running statistical tests on quantitative data, or generating visualizations.</li><li><strong>Drafting & Editing:</strong> Use the AI as a writing partner to draft sections of your paper, improve clarity, check for grammatical errors, and ensure a consistent tone.</li></ol></main></div></body></html>
