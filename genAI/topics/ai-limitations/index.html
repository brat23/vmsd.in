            <h2>The Imperfect Mind</h2>
            <p>As powerful as Large Language Models are, they are not infallible. Understanding their limitations is crucial for using them responsibly and effectively. These models do not "think" or "understand" in the human sense; they are sophisticated pattern-matching systems.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> This is one of the most well-known limitations. An AI hallucination occurs when the model generates text that is factually incorrect, nonsensical, or completely fabricated, but presents it with complete confidence. This happens because the model is always trying to generate the most probable next word, and sometimes that path leads away from factual accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Bias:</strong> LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text from the internet, which contains human biases. The models can learn and amplify these biases, leading to outputs that may be prejudiced against certain groups, genders, or viewpoints.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge Cutoff:</strong> A model's knowledge is frozen at the point its training data was collected. It has no awareness of events, discoveries, or information that has appeared since its training was completed.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of True Understanding:</strong> Models don't possess common sense or a true understanding of the physical or social world. They can make logical errors or fail to grasp subtle contextual nuances that a human would easily understand.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
            <p>The widespread use of AI raises significant ethical questions that users and developers must consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Misinformation:</strong> The ability to generate plausible-sounding text makes LLMs a powerful tool for creating and spreading misinformation at scale.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> The automation of tasks previously done by humans raises concerns about the future of work and the economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Using personal data to train or prompt models carries a risk of that data being exposed or misused.</li>
                <li><strong>Authorship and Copyright:</strong> The question of who owns AI-generated content—the user, the AI developer, or no one—is a complex legal and ethical issue.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A critical and discerning approach is your best tool when working with any AI. Always verify important information and be mindful of the potential for bias in the responses you receive.</p>
