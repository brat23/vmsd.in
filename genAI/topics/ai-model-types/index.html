            <h2>A Spectrum of Intelligence</h2>
            <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, Gemini, and Claude are the most well-known, the world of generative AI is filled with a diverse range of model types, each with specialized skills and architectures.</p>
            
            <h2>Major Language Model Families</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Series:</strong> Developed by OpenAI, these models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4) are known for their strong conversational abilities, creativity, and reasoning skills. They are general-purpose models that excel at a wide variety of tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Gemini Family:</strong> Developed by Google, Gemini models are natively multimodal, meaning they are designed from the ground up to understand and process information from different formats like text, images, audio, and video simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>Claude Family:</strong> Developed by Anthropic, Claude models are known for their focus on AI safety and constitutional AI, with a strong emphasis on producing helpful and harmless responses. They often have large context windows, allowing them to process very long documents.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Specialized and Open-Source Models</h2>
            <p>Beyond the major families, there's a thriving ecosystem of specialized and open-source models:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Generation Models:</strong> Tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E are not language models but "diffusion models." They are trained to generate novel images from text descriptions by starting with random noise and progressively refining it into a coherent picture.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Generation Models:</strong> Models like OpenAI's Codex (the backbone of GitHub Copilot) are LLMs that have been specifically fine-tuned on massive datasets of public code, making them exceptionally good at writing, completing, and debugging code.</li>
                <li><strong>Open-Source Models:</strong> A vibrant community of researchers and developers contributes to powerful open-source models like Meta's Llama series, Mistral, and Falcon. These models can be downloaded and run on local hardware, offering greater control and privacy.</li>
            </ul>
