When used ethically, it can significantly enhance the research and writing process, but it must be used as an assistant, not a replacement for original thought.</p><h2>Ethical Uses</h2><ul><li><strong>Literature Search and Summarization:</strong> Use AI to find and summarize relevant papers to build your literature review.</li><li><strong>Paraphrasing and Clarity:</strong> Use an LLM to rephrase your own ideas for better clarity or to avoid repetitive sentence structures.</li><li><strong>Grammar and Style Checking:</strong> Use AI as an advanced proofreader to catch errors and improve the flow of your writing.</li><li><strong>Citation Management:</strong> Ask an AI to format your bibliography into a specific citation style (e.g., APA, MLA), but always double-check the output for accuracy.</li></ul><h2>Unethical Uses</h2><p>Submitting AI-generated text as your own original work is plagiarism and a serious academic offense. Never use an AI to write entire sections of a paper for you. The goal is to use AI to enhance your own thinking and writing, not to replace it.</p></main></div></body></html>
