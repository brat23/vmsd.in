AI can assist in the creation of these dynamic tools.</p><h2>AI-Assisted Dashboarding</h2><p>While an LLM can't produce a fully interactive dashboard in a chat window, it can write the code for one. You can ask it to generate the code for a dashboard using popular Python libraries like Plotly Dash or Streamlit. You can describe the desired layout, charts, and interactive elements (like dropdowns or sliders), and the AI will generate a script that you can then run to launch the dashboard as a web application.</p></main></div></body></html>
