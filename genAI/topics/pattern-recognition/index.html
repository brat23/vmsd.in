They can analyze large datasets and identify trends, clusters, and anomalies that might be invisible to a human analyst.</p><h2>Common Techniques</h2><ul><li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> You can feed time-series data into an AI and ask it to identify and describe the key trends, seasonality, and cyclical patterns.</li><li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> AI can spot unusual data points that deviate from the norm. This is critical for tasks like fraud detection, network security monitoring, and identifying faulty equipment from sensor data.</li><li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> By analyzing customer behavior and demographic data, an AI can group similar customers into segments, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing and product strategies more effectively.</li></ul></p></main></div></body></html>
