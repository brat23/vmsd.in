Iterative refinement is the process of continuously testing, analyzing, and improving your AI-powered workflow.</p><h2>The Feedback Loop</h2><p>This process involves:<ul><li><strong>Testing:</strong> Run your workflow with a variety of inputs and edge cases.</li><li><strong>Analyzing Failures:</strong> When the system produces a poor output, diagnose the root cause. Was it a weak prompt? Was the data in the wrong format?</li><li><strong>Refining:</strong> Make small, targeted changes to your prompts, scripts, or workflow logic to address the failures.</li><li><strong>Measuring:</strong> Track the performance of your system over time against a set of quality metrics to ensure your changes are leading to real improvements.</li></ul></p></main></div></body></html>
