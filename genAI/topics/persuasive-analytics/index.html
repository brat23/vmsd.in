Persuasive analytics is about using data and narrative to make a compelling case for a specific decision.</p><h2>From Insight to Influence</h2><p>An AI can help you frame your findings in a more persuasive way. Instead of just stating the facts, you can ask the AI to help you build an argument. For example: "Based on this data showing a 15% drop in user engagement, write a compelling argument for prioritizing the development of a new community feature." The AI can help you anticipate objections, highlight the potential benefits, and create a clear call to action.</p></main></div></body></html>
