By giving the AI a specific rubric or set of criteria, you can get targeted feedback that is far more detailed than what a human peer might provide. For example: "Critique this essay based on the clarity of its thesis, the strength of its evidence, and its overall structure."</p><h2>Progress Tracking</h2><p>By regularly engaging with an AI tutor and completing its assessments, you can create a record of your learning journey. You can ask the AI to summarize your progress over the past month, identify the topics you've mastered, and suggest what you should focus on next to continue improving.</p></main></div></body></html>
