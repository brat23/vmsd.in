Frameworks provide a structured process for generating and developing new ideas. AI can be used as a tool within these frameworks.</p><h2>Example: SCAMPER</h2><p>SCAMPER is a framework that uses action verbs to spark new ideas. You can use an AI to apply it to an existing product or service:<ul><li><strong>Substitute:</strong> "What if we substitute our plastic packaging with a biodegradable material?"</li><li><strong>Combine:</strong> "How can we combine our coffee shop with a bookstore?"</li><li><strong>Adapt:</strong> "How can we adapt the subscription model of Netflix to our clothing brand?"</li><li><strong>Modify:</strong> "What if we modify our app to serve a younger audience?"</li><li><strong>Put to another use:</strong> "Can we put our delivery infrastructure to another use during off-peak hours?"</li><li><strong>Eliminate:</strong> "What features can we eliminate from our software to make it simpler?"</li><li><strong>Reverse:</strong> "What if customers paid us to take their used products back?"</li></ul></p></main></div></body></html>
