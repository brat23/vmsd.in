AI can be an invaluable partner in this process of connection and insight.</p><h2>From Multiple Sources to a Single View</h2><p>You can provide an LLM with text from multiple sources—articles, reports, interview transcripts—and ask it to synthesize the key themes, identify points of agreement or disagreement, and create a unified summary. This is incredibly useful for understanding complex topics with many different perspectives.</p><h2>Identifying Gaps and Future Directions</h2><p>By analyzing a body of existing research, an AI can help identify gaps in the current literature. You can prompt it with questions like, "Given these articles, what are the key unanswered questions?" or "What are the limitations of the current research?" This can help you define a novel and impactful research question of your own.</p></main></div></body></html>
