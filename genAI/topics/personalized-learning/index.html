Ask it to explain a complex topic at different levels of depth, from a simple analogy to a detailed technical explanation. You can ask it to create a custom study plan for you based on your goals and current knowledge, and it can generate practice questions and exercises tailored to the areas where you are weakest.</p><h2>The Socratic Method</h2><p>Instead of just asking an AI for the answer, ask it to teach you by using the Socratic method. Prompt it with: "Teach me about photosynthesis, but do it by asking me questions to see what I know and guiding me to the right conclusions." This active learning approach is far more effective for long-term retention than passive consumption of information.</p></main></div></body></html>
