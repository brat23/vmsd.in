A well-framed problem is specific, measurable, and broken down into its core components.</p><h2>The Structured Approach</h2><p>Instead of a vague goal like "improve customer satisfaction," a good AI problem definition would be: "Analyze the last 1000 customer support tickets, categorize them into key issue types, and identify the top 3 most common complaints that can be addressed with a new FAQ section." This structured approach gives the AI a clear context, a defined task, and a measurable outcome.</p></main></div></body></html>
